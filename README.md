/////Written in Processing, exported to Java/////

A prototype of a larger subversive sunlight campaign, this application draws large-scale JSON data from the NY Times Campaign Finance and Congress APIs. In two clicks, a user can access the voting stance and significant donor list of any Representative or Senator. The program parses the JSON response and evaluates the information for completeness. It simplifies the political stance of the subject based on prior voting records. As a proof of concept, it is highly intriguing. And, it inspires a sense of disgust with the current state of information re: elected representatives in the US (e.g., much of the time, the JSON data is incomplete or unhelpful). In my brief experience, it is in fact extremely difficult to acquire a relevant and quality data set. At the time of the project, the NY Times was really the only remaining API for this information.

This sketch will require a unique API key.

Also, the NY Times API has undoubtedly changed since this project was created in Spring 2013. Be flexible.
